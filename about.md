This blog is a project long overdue. Sometime in 2014, I made up the decision to write blog articles. But the designer in me was never satisfied with the pre-defined templates available on Blogger or Wordpress. I wanted to design my own blog, but had no idea of PHP and still don't. I kept on searching for solutions, but failed. Then I forgot about it. The dream faded away. 

One day when I was just browsing at random, I stumbled upon Jekyll. It was just perfect! I person with no knowledge of Wordpress or PHP can design their own site using Jekyll. It was sometime in May of 2017. Watched some YouTube videos and I was through. Here it is. A blog designed by me!

The next step was to decide upon the blog name. I knew that my thought process and understanding of life is very practical, scientific and logical. This gave birth to 'Pragmatic'. I knew that I was going to write articles of a plethora of genres. Searched a lot and finalised 'Abstractions', sounded cool! 'Pragmatic Abstractions', a collection of my thoughts, however wrong or harsh. 

I aim to write at least once every fortnight and I hope all you like my work. Feel free to connect with me or write about your views in the comment section of every post.

Signing off!
