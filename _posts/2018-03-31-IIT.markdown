I still remember, vaguely. I was in class 7. My father and I were talking, just like any other day. But on that particular day, he told me about the amazing life that one leads in and after IITs. At that very moment, I had made up my mind. I need to get into one! A goal was set, crystal clear. It wasn't like a kid's plan to become an astronaut. This was different. 

After setting goals, the next phase is planning. I started researching. Found out that the entrance exam, IIT-JEE (as it was called then), was not tough, it was making-a-rocket-climbing-the-everest-making-it-out-alive-the-bermuda-triangle tough. It was a lot to take in for a 12-year-old. After the disappointing start of the research phase, I gained some courage (I am still searching for that source of courage!) and started searching for best places to prepare. Found the answer pretty quickly, Kota! A plan was made. Leave home, parents, friends, go to Kota, forget about any sort of luxury and study as-hard-as-you-can. 

Time passed, I reached class 9. It became clear to me that I couldn’t stand biology, commerce was just not my thing and I adored Science (less Biology) and Maths. The goal and the plan solidified further. 

A little fast-forward, the judgement day, the day to leave home. My parents had visited Kota a few days before the alleged judgement day and finalised a PG room for me. On their return, my mom said, let me correct, dictated that she won’t allow me to leave home. I respected that, but was determined and softly dismissed her decision. Back to judgement day. The heart was full of emotions, but fixated towards the goal. Completed one year in Kota, the year was 2012. Had studied hard, performed well and was delighted to be back home. But festivities eventually end. 

The second and final year in Kota. It became the 'plot-twist' of my life. I was much more mature than that 12-year-old kid. I started contemplating. What was I doing? Why did I want to get into an IIT? Was engineering really for me? I had suddenly lost interest in PCM. Yeah, you can suddenly lose interest in things you adore, that’s life. 

The entire plan was on the premise of a goal which was decided on the basis of a word, ‘amazing’. The naïve kid didn’t think about what branch he would choose (upon which your career depends or rather should), what would he do after graduating from an IIT. It was at that point in time that I realised that goals should be set for multiple phases and not one. It is indeed necessary to think not only about 5 years from now, but also 10 years from now or 15 years from now. Lesson learned, I started searching for options, because there was no going back. 

I was lucky, I found Economics! Yeah, even IITs have Economics programs! I was more or less sure that I would go for a MBA after graduation, so choosing Economics would be the best thing for me. It was decided, the goal and the plan were fine tuned. 3 months were left for the first hurdle - JEE Mains. Told myself to just hold on, study as hard as possible. I collected hundreds (literally!) of practice papers for the exam and started solving them, to increase my speed (my biggest weakness). Gave JEE Mains, did good (scored 270 out of 360!), and qualified for JEE Advanced. Practiced, practiced and practiced again. Wrote atleast two 3-hour practice papers everyday. 

Judgement Day v2.0: June 2, 2013. The mind was empty, as if I knew nothing. Sat for the exam all peaceful (contrary to what I imagined i.e. full of anxiety, tension and what not). Attempted both the papers with all I had to offer, and I was happy with myself, I had given my best. Didn't care about the results. The days after the exam were pure bliss. 

The results were expected on June 23, a Sunday. My birthday and my parents' anniversary is on June 21, so we had planned for a small party on June 23 (for the triple bonanza). To everyone's surprise, the results were announced on June 21. The JEE team gave me the best birthday gift possible, an All India Rank of 1099! Anywho, the party was celebrated on the Sunday :P

The plan was set, I wanted Economics. But that rank did not make it easy. Based on the past trends, I could get Computer Science in IIT Guwahati, Mathematics and Computing at IIT Kanpur, and some really good traditional options at other IITs. Talked to a bunch of people, got several sorts of advice. Also the best opening rank for Economics was around 2600. Scoring only 85 in 12th Boards in Maths (lowest marks amongst all subjects for me), I knew I wasn't good at math. Competing with great minds of the country at a thing I wasn't that good at seemed illogical, plain and simple. I took the risk and filled Economics at IIT Kanpur as my top priority in the counselling. I got selected for the program and everyone was in a shock with what I did. (1099 is still the best opening rank for Economics in any IIT so far!)

With proper planning and consistency, I had achieved my goal. I got into an IIT! The life now would be 'amazing'! Well, it was or was it?

Part 2 of the article is coming soon, most probably next week!
