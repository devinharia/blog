I still remember, vaguely. I was in class 7. My father and I were talking and he told me about the amazing life one leads in and after IITs. At that very moment, I had made up my mind. I need to get into one! A goal was set, crystal clear. 

After setting goals, the next phase is planning. I started researching. Found out that the entrance exam, IIT-JEE (as it was called then), was not tough, it was making-a-rocket-climbing-the-everest-making-it-out-alive-the-bermuda-triangle tough. It was a lot to take in for a 12-year-old. After the disappointing start of research, I gained some courage (I am still searching for that source of courage!) and started searching for best places to prepare. The answer was found pretty quickly, Kota!
